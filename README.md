# Blightnauts Dialogue
This is a tool for creating character dialogue in custom level for Awesomenauts.
Originally this was used to create the dialogue for the custom level Blightnauts, but now I am attempting to expand this tool to allow anyone to add character dialogue in their own custom levels.

This tool works by auto-generating all the .xml files the game needs to render the dialogue on screen.
The level creator only needs to input the text, character portrait and the start and end times, as well as basic editing using the game's own tools.
